1. Generates a public-private RSA key pair. Uses RSA-4096. Key size is 4096 bits. 
Saves your public key as a file named key.pub.
2. Generates an unencrypted text file named ”message”. 
It is in plain ASCII format (no Word or PDF docs).
Contains (1) your first and last name, (2) your ID, and (3) the string "4130Lab4".
3. First, sign your message with your private key. Puts signed message to
signature.sig file.
4. Encrypts the message by using the class public key and puts the ciphertext to message.encr file.
